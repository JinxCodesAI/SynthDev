# Phase 4: Smart Git Branch Management

## Overview

This phase adds intelligent feature branch creation and management to isolate AI changes from the main development branch.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want AI changes to be isolated on feature branches, so that my main development branch stays clean and stable
- As a developer, I want feature branches to be created automatically only when I have uncommitted changes, so that I don't get unnecessary branches for clean repositories
- As a developer, I want branch names to be based on my instructions, so that I can easily identify what each branch contains
- As a developer, I want to easily merge successful AI changes back to my original branch, so that I can incorporate the improvements into my main work
- As a developer, I want to easily discard AI changes by switching back without merging, so that I can abandon unsuccessful experiments
- As a developer, I want to see clear status information about which branches are active, so that I understand my current Git state

## Deliverables

- Automatic feature branch creation (only when uncommitted changes exist)
- Branch naming based on user instructions (using existing GitUtils.generateBranchName)
- Branch merge operations via `/snapshot merge`
- Branch switch operations via `/snapshot switch`
- Smart branch creation logic
- Branch status display

## Technical Components

- Branch creation decision logic
- Branch naming and sanitization
- Branch lifecycle management
- Merge and switch operations
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Branch status tracking and display

## Documentation to be Added

- Branch creation decision logic
- Branch naming conventions and sanitization
- Merge vs switch workflow specification
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Branch lifecycle management
- User interface for branch operations
- Integration with existing GitUtils
- Test scenarios for various Git states

## Success Criteria

- Feature branches created automatically only when appropriate
- Original branch remains untouched during AI sessions
- Easy merge/discard workflow through snapshot commands
- No unnecessary branches created for clean repositories
- Clear branch status information

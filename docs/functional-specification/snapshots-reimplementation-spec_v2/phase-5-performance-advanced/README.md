# Phase 5: Performance and Advanced Features

## Overview

This phase focuses on optimizing performance and adding advanced snapshot management features for power users.

## User Stories

- As a developer with many snapshots, I want fast snapshot operations, so that the system doesn't slow down my workflow
- As a developer, I want to search through my snapshots by description or date, so that I can quickly find specific states
- As a developer, I want to see detailed information about snapshot contents, so that I can understand what changed
- As a developer, I want automatic cleanup of old snapshots based on age or count, so that I don't need to manually manage storage
- As a developer, I want to export/import snapshots, so that I can share states with team members or backup important states
- As a developer, I want comprehensive error recovery, so that I can handle edge cases gracefully

## Deliverables

- Performance optimizations for large numbers of snapshots
- Snapshot search and filtering capabilities
- Enhanced snapshot details view with file diffs
- Automatic cleanup policies
- Snapshot export/import functionality
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Technical Components

- Performance optimization strategies
- Search and indexing system
- Snapshot comparison and diff generation
- Cleanup policy engine
- Export/import serialization
- Advanced error handling and recovery

## Documentation to be Added

- Performance optimization strategies
- Search and filtering implementation
- Snapshot comparison algorithms
- Cleanup policy configuration
- Export/import format specification
- Error handling and recovery procedures
- Advanced features user guide
- Performance benchmarking results

## Success Criteria

- Fast performance with hundreds of snapshots
- Easy search and discovery of snapshots
- Rich information display with file change details
- Automatic maintenance reduces manual overhead
- Robust error handling covers edge cases

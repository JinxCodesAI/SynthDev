# Phase 2: Automatic Snapshot Creation

## Overview

This phase implements automatic snapshot creation triggered by deterministic tool execution events, transforming the snapshot system from manual to intelligent automation. The system monitors file-modifying tools and file system changes, creating snapshots automatically before any file modifications occur, providing seamless protection without user intervention.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want snapshots to be created automatically when tools modify files, so that I don't need to remember to create them manually
- As a developer, I want to see which tool triggered each snapshot, so that I can understand what changes were made
- As a developer, I want the system to avoid creating empty snapshots for read-only operations, so that my snapshot list stays relevant
- As a developer, I want automatic snapshots to have meaningful descriptions based on the tool and files being modified, so that I can easily identify them later
- As a developer, I want to configure which tools trigger snapshots, so that I can customize the behavior for my workflow
- As a developer, I want an initial snapshot created when I start working in a project, so that I always have a "state 0" to return to

## Deliverables

- Automatic snapshot creation on tool execution (integrated with ToolManager)
- Tool execution metadata in snapshots
- Smart handling of read-only tools (no snapshots for read_file, list_directory, etc.)
- Integration with existing tool execution lifecycle
- Configuration for tool-based snapshot triggers
- Initial "state 0" snapshot on application startup
- File system monitoring for change detection

## Technical Components

### Core Components

- **ToolMonitor** - Monitors tool execution to determine if snapshots should be created
- **SnapshotTrigger** - Coordinates automatic snapshot creation based on tool execution
- **FileChangeDetector** - Monitors file system for actual file modifications
- **InitialSnapshotManager** - Creates "state 0" snapshot on application startup
- **ToolExecutionHooks** - Hooks into tool execution lifecycle for snapshot coordination

### Integration Points

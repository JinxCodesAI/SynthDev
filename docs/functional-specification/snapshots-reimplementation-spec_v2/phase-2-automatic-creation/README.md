# Phase 2: Automatic Snapshot Creation

## Overview

This phase adds automatic snapshot creation triggered by user instructions, eliminating the need for manual snapshot management.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want snapshots to be created automatically when I give AI instructions, so that I don't need to remember to create them manually
- As a developer, I want to see the original instruction that triggered each snapshot, so that I can understand what changes were made
- As a developer, I want the system to avoid creating empty snapshots for read-only operations, so that my snapshot list stays relevant
- As a developer, I want automatic snapshots to have meaningful descriptions based on my instructions, so that I can easily identify them later
- As a developer, I want to configure which types of instructions trigger snapshots, so that I can customize the behavior for my workflow

## Deliverables

- Automatic snapshot creation on user input (integrated with app.js)
- Instruction metadata in snapshots
- Smart handling of read-only operations (no snapshots for /help, /cost, etc.)
- Integration with existing tool execution lifecycle
- Configuration for snapshot triggers

## Technical Components

- Integration with app.js user input processing
- Instruction parsing and classification
- Tool execution hooks for file backup
- Configuration system for snapshot triggers
- Smart empty snapshot detection

## Documentation to be Added

- Integration specification with app.js
- Automatic trigger logic design
- Instruction parsing and metadata handling
- Empty snapshot detection algorithm
- Configuration options specification
- Updated user interface specification
- Test scenarios for automatic creation

## Success Criteria

- Snapshots created automatically before AI processes file-modifying instructions
- No manual intervention required for basic workflow
- Clear snapshot descriptions based on user instructions
- No snapshots created for commands or read-only operations
- User can configure snapshot behavior

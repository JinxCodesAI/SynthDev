# Phase 1: Basic In-Memory Snapshots

## Overview

This phase implements the foundation of the snapshot system with in-memory file storage and manual snapshot management.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to manually create a snapshot with a description, so that I can save the current state before making risky changes
- As a developer, I want to list all my snapshots with timestamps and descriptions, so that I can identify which state to restore to
- As a developer, I want to restore to any previous snapshot, so that I can undo unwanted changes
- As a developer, I want to see which files will be affected before restoring, so that I can make an informed decision
- As a developer, I want only relevant project files to be included in snapshots, so that I don't waste storage on dependencies like node_modules
- As a developer, I want to delete old snapshots, so that I can manage storage and keep my snapshot list clean
- As a developer, I want to configure which files and directories are excluded from snapshots, so that I can customize the filtering for my specific project needs
- As a developer, I want to configure snapshot behavior settings, so that I can adapt the system to my workflow preferences

## Deliverables

- Manual snapshot creation via `/snapshot create "description"`
- Snapshot listing via `/snapshot list`
- File-based restoration via `/snapshot restore <id>`
- Snapshot deletion via `/snapshot delete <id>`
- Basic file backup when tools modify files
- File filtering system (exclude node_modules, .git, etc.)
- Configuration system for snapshot behavior and file filtering

## Technical Components

- SnapshotManager (main orchestrator)
- MemorySnapshotStore (in-memory storage)
- FileFilter (file inclusion/exclusion logic)
- SnapshotsCommand (following ADR-002 patterns)
- FileBackup (file capture and restoration)

## Phase Documentation

This phase includes comprehensive planning and design documents:

### Planning Documents

- **[Solution Architecture](./solution_architecture.md)** - Technical architecture design including component interactions, data flow, and system integration patterns
- **[Development Plan](./development_plan.md)** - Detailed implementation roadmap with subphases, timelines, dependencies, and delivery milestones
- **[Automated Tests Architecture](./automated_tests_architecture.md)** - Comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, and end-to-end test scenarios
- **[Quality Assurance Tests](./quality_assurance_tests.md)** - Step-by-step manual testing procedures for user acceptance and edge case validation

### Implementation Guidance

- **Solution Architecture**: Defines core components (SnapshotManager, MemoryStore, FileFilter, etc.) and their interactions
- **Development Plan**: Breaks down work into 3 subphases over 2 weeks with specific deliverables and acceptance criteria
- **Testing Strategy**: Ensures >90% test coverage with automated and manual validation procedures
- **Quality Assurance**: Provides comprehensive manual testing scenarios for user experience validation

## Implementation Subphases

### Subphase 1.1: Core Snapshot Functionality

- Manual snapshot creation, listing, restoration, and deletion
- Basic file backup and restoration
- In-memory storage implementation

### Subphase 1.2: File Filtering System

- Default file filtering (node_modules, .git, build artifacts, etc.)
- File pattern matching and exclusion logic
- Integration with snapshot creation and backup processes

### Subphase 1.3: Configuration System

- Configuration file structure for snapshot settings
- File filtering configuration (custom exclusion patterns)
- Snapshot behavior configuration (storage limits, naming patterns, etc.)
- Integration with existing SynthDev configuration system following src/config patterns

## Success Criteria

- Can create snapshots manually with descriptive names
- Can restore files to previous state accurately
- Files are properly backed up before modification
- Only relevant files are included (no node_modules, build artifacts, etc.)
- User sees clear feedback on all operations
- Can clean up old snapshots
- Configuration system allows customization of file filtering and snapshot behavior
- Configuration follows SynthDev patterns and integrates with existing config system

# Test Failure Analysis: Tool Integration Snapshots - edit_file Tool Execution

## Test Overview

**Failing Test**: `Tool Integration Snapshots > should create snapshot before edit_file tool execution`

**Expected Behavior**: The test expects the `edit_file` tool to successfully execute and modify a file, while the snapshot system creates a backup before the modification.

**Actual Behavior**: The test fails because the `edit_file` tool execution fails with the error: `"boundary_start string must appear before boundary_end string in the file"`

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The test is failing due to a logical issue in how the test is structured, not due to the snapshot integration itself. Here's what's happening:

1. **Test Setup**: The test creates a file with content:

    ```
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    ```

2. **Tool Parameters**: The test calls `edit_file` with:

    ```javascript
    {
        file_path: testFile,
        operation: 'replace',
        boundary_start: 'Line 2',    // Same string
        boundary_end: 'Line 2',      // Same string
        new_content: 'Modified Line 2'
    }
    ```

3. **Tool Logic**: The `edit_file` tool implementation:
    - Finds all occurrences of `boundary_start` ("Line 2") → finds it at index 7
    - Finds all occurrences of `boundary_end` ("Line 2") → finds it at the same index 7
    - Validates that `startIdx < endIdx` (line 198 in `src/tools/edit_file/implementation.js`)
    - Since `7 >= 7` is true, it fails with the error message

### The Core Issue

**When `boundary_start` and `boundary_end` are identical strings, they will always be found at the same position, making it impossible for the start boundary to appear "before" the end boundary.**

This is a fundamental design constraint of the `edit_file` tool - it requires two distinct boundary strings that appear in sequence to define a range of text to replace.

## Snapshot Integration Status

**Important**: The snapshot integration is actually working correctly! The test output shows:

```
ℹ️ Creating snapshot: Pre-execution snapshot before edit_file on test-temp/tool-integration-test-1752672976946/edit-test.txt
ℹ️ Snapshot created successfully: snap_1752672977105_7081d67c_2aef4e8e
```

The snapshot system successfully:

1. Detected that `edit_file` is a file-modifying tool
2. Created a pre-execution snapshot before the tool ran
3. Backed up the original file content

The test failure occurs **after** the snapshot is created, during the actual tool execution phase.

## Test Design Issue

The test is using an invalid scenario for the `edit_file` tool. According to the tool's design (as seen in `src/tools/edit_file/definition.json`):

- `boundary_start`: "Unique string that marks the beginning of the section to edit"
- `boundary_end`: "Unique string that marks the end of the section to edit"

The boundaries are meant to define a **range** of content, not a single point.

## Correct Test Scenarios

### Option 1: Use Different Boundary Strings

```javascript
const toolCall = {
    id: 'test-call-2',
    function: {
        name: 'edit_file',
        arguments: JSON.stringify({
            file_path: testFile,
            operation: 'replace',
            boundary_start: 'Line 2',
            boundary_end: 'Line 3',
            new_content: 'Modified Line 2\nModified Line 3',
        }),
    },
};
```

### Option 2: Use Proper Boundary Markers

```javascript
// Create file with proper boundaries
const testFile = createTestFile(
    'edit-test.txt',
    'Line 1\n<!-- START -->\nLine 2\n<!-- END -->\nLine 3'
);

const toolCall = {
    id: 'test-call-2',
    function: {
        name: 'edit_file',
        arguments: JSON.stringify({
            file_path: testFile,
            operation: 'replace',
            boundary_start: '<!-- START -->',
            boundary_end: '<!-- END -->',
            new_content: '<!-- START -->\nModified Line 2\n<!-- END -->',
        }),
    },
};
```

### Option 3: Use Line-Based Boundaries

```javascript
const toolCall = {
    id: 'test-call-2',
    function: {
        name: 'edit_file',
        arguments: JSON.stringify({
            file_path: testFile,
            operation: 'replace',
            boundary_start: 'Line 1\nLine 2',
            boundary_end: 'Line 2\nLine 3',
            new_content: 'Line 1\nModified Line 2\nLine 3',
        }),
    },
};
```

## Conclusion

**The snapshot integration is working correctly.** The test failure is due to an invalid test case that violates the `edit_file` tool's design constraints. The tool requires distinct start and end boundaries to define a range of content to replace.

**Recommendation**: Update the test to use valid boundary strings that define a proper range, rather than using the same string for both boundaries.

# SynthDev Documentation v2

**SynthDev** is a powerful Node.js console-based AI coding assistant with an extensible tool system and command interface. It provides comprehensive development tools, multi-model support, and sophisticated conversation management capabilities. Its main intention is to **explore agentic capabilities** of **less powerful AI models**.

## What is SynthDev?

SynthDev is an AI-powered development assistant that provides:

- **üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Tool System**: File operations, code execution, terminal access, and analysis tools
- **‚ö° Command Interface**: Powerful `/` commands for managing conversations, costs, and application state
- **ü§ñ Multi-Model Support**: Configure different AI models for different tasks (base, smart, fast)
- **üé≠ AI Role System**: Specialized AI personas with role-specific behaviors and few-shot prompting
- **üîß Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools and commands
- **üìä Advanced Features**: Conversation snapshots, codebase indexing, prompt enhancement, and cost tracking

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 20.10.0 or higher (ES Modules support required)
- **Operating System**: Tested on Windows, WSL and Linux docker container
- **AI API**: Tested on less powerful models like google-Flash-2.5 and gpt-4.1-mini/nano

### AI Role System

SynthDev features specialized AI personas for different tasks:

#### **Development Roles**

- **coder**: Software development and implementation
- **reviewer**: Code review and quality assurance
- **architect**: System design and architecture planning
- **test_writer**: Specialized test writing assistant
- **qa_specialist**: Quality assurance and bug detection

#### **Analysis Roles**

- **codebase_explainer**: Explaining codebase functionality
- **file_summarizer**: Analyzing and summarizing individual files
- **directory_summarizer**: Analyzing directory structures
- **research_assistant**: Information gathering and analysis

#### **Utility Roles**

- **prompt_enhancer**: Improving user prompts with AI assistance
- **command_generator**: Converting natural language to terminal commands
- **file_reader**: File reading and analysis only
- **dude**: Helpful assistant for wide range of tasks

Switch roles with: `/role <role_name>`

### Multi-Agent Workflows

SynthDev supports complex multi-agent workflows where different AI personas collaborate:

- **üîÑ State Machine Execution**: Structured workflow with defined states and transitions
- **üí¨ Shared Context**: Agents share conversation context with role-based message mapping

- **Code Execution**: execute_script, execute_terminal
- **Utilities**: calculate, get_time

### Codebase Intelligence

Index your codebase for AI-powered understanding:

```bash
/index                    # Index with default settings
/index --max-size 50000   # Set maximum file size
/index --include-hidden   # Include hidden files
```

Ask questions about your codebase:

- "What tools are available in this codebase?"
- "How is file editing handled?"
- "Explain the architecture of the command system"

# Synth-Dev

## About

A Node.js console based AI coding assistant.

Deeply inspired by [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), [Roo-Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code), [Augument Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). 

Shamelessly vibe-coded with use of Cursor and Augument Code, blissfully in JavaScript, like [Dylan's Beattie's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxi0ETwDvws&t=250s) never existed.

For more serious documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

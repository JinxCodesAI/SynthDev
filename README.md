# Synth-Dev

## About

A Node.js console based AI coding assistant.

> **Note:** Please clone this repository from the `stable` branch to ensure stability.
> The `main` branch is currently under active development and may contain experimental features.

To clone the repository from the `stable` branch, use the following command:

```bash
git clone --branch stable https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
```

Deeply inspired by [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), [Roo-Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code), [Augument Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

Shamelessly vibe-coded with use of Cursor and Augument Code, blissfully in JavaScript, like [Dylan's Beattie's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxi0ETwDvws&t=250s) never existed.

Code tested with GPT-4.1-mini and GPT-4.1-nano (fast) and alternatively with Gemini Flash 2.5 with sensible results.

For more serious documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) (AI generated obviously)

## Usage

```bash
npm install
```

Setup your .env file, see [config.example.env](config.example.env) for details. All environment variables now use the `SYNTHDEV_` prefix.

```bash
npm start
```

You can also do:

```bash
npm install -g .
```

and then run synth-dev from anywhere with:

```bash
synth-dev
```

This allows you to use synth-dev on any codebase you downloaded.

Accepts either a single file path string or an array of file paths. Supports various file types including text files (.txt), configuration files (.json, .yaml, .xml), code files (.js, .py, .html, .css), documentation (.md, .rst), and log files. Provides detailed error handling for common file access issues like missing files, permission errors, or encoding problems. Returns the raw file content as a string while maintaining original formatting, line breaks, and character encoding. Includes file metadata such as size and modification time for additional context.",
